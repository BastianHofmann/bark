    "First, we will go into detail of the OpenDrive format, then we will give an overview how to import and analyze the maps and, finally, how to efficiently use them within BARK.\n",
    "\n",
    "BARK, therefore, extends the OpenDrive format using Road- and Lane-Corridors.\n",
    "These are routing based road and lane abstractions that provide an easy-to-use interface for any agent/planner.\n",

    "## OpenDrive Format\n",
    "\n",
    "We outline the most important aspects of the OpenDrive format here.\n",
    "Each map-file is represented in a XML-format in which roads, junctions and lanes are defined.\n",
    "As BARK does not support signals (e.g. traffic lights), these are omitted in the following discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each road in the OpenDrive format has a PlanView that provides a geometric definition of the road.\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<planView>\n",
    "   <geometry s=\"0\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" hdg=\"1.5707963267987366e+00\" length=\"100\">\n",
    "      <line/>\n",
    "   </geometry>\n",
    "</planView>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The geometries within the PlanView can be lines, arcs or spirals.\n",
    "\n",
    "And each road has LaneSections that define a certain length of the road.\n",
    "Within a lane section the number of lanes is constant.\n",
    "Thus, by using LaneSections it is possible to change the number of lanes in a single lane.\n",
    "A LaneSection has one or multiple lanes that are derived from the PlanViews geometry and then iteratively from the inner lane's geometry.\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<laneSection s=\"0.0000000000000000e+00\">\n",
    "   <lane id=\"3\" type=\"sidewalk\" level= \"false\">\n",
    "      <link>\n",
    "         <predecessor id=\"-1\"/>\n",
    "         <successor id=\"-1\"/>\n",
    "      </link>\n",
    "      <width sOffset=\"0\" a=\"1.5\" b=\"0\" c=\"0\" d=-0\"/>\n",
    "   </lane>\n",
    "</laneSection>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each lane and road can have predecessors and successors defined.\n",
    "Additionally, for more complex linking, such as intersections junctions can be used.\n",
    "Junctions are defined as\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<junction name=\"\" id=\"2\">\n",
    "   <connection id=\"0\" incomingRoad=\"8\" connectingRoad=\"4\" contactPoint=\"start\">\n",
    "      <laneLink from=\"1\" to=\"-1\"/>\n",
    "      <laneLink from=\"2\" to=\"-2\"/>\n",
    "      <laneLink from=\"3\" to=\"-3\"/>\n",
    "   </connection>\n",
    "</junction>\n",
    "```\n",
    "having lane-links and connections for the roads.\n",
    "\n",
    "BARK initially stores the map in exactly the same structure as the OpenDrive format in c++.\n",
    "These c++ files can be found in the folder `modules/world/opendrive/':\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "BUILD                   junction.hpp            lane_section.cpp        odrSpiral.hpp           plan_view.hpp\n",

    "## BARK-specific Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally to the OpenDrive structure BARK creates a *RoadGraph*, that includes all lanes and their connections. The RoadGraph, therefore, provides an abstraction layer and easy-to-use interface to query the OpenDrive format -- e.g. it can be used for routing. The implementation of the RoadGraph can be found in `modules/world/map/roadgraph.hpp'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *MapInterface* implements functions, such as a routing function and other utility functions.\n",
    "It also generates routing specific RoadCorridors and LaneCorridors.\n",
    "Each agent in BARK has at least one RoadCorridor that it is following.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *RoadCorridor* can be seen as a route specific OpenDrive road that the agent is following.\n",
    "Each agent can act within its RoadCorridor, such as following the lane or changing the lanes within it.\n",
    "The agent can e.g. query the RoadCorridor on which lane it currently is and if there are neighboring lanes that it can change to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A RoadCorridor has additonally *LaneCorridors*. These are consecutive concatenated lanes within the RoadCorridor that provide additonal utility functions.\n",
